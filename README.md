# Scholarius

Scholarius is a lightweight web-based quiz and testing platform suitable for classrooms, self-study, certification preparation, and technical training.

The goal of Scholarius is to provide a flexiable instant on system ready for imediate use.

It is my opinion that I shouldn't have had to create this.  Commercial systems abound and across a decade I really don't like the price creap of products.
